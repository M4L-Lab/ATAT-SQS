Please follow instruction to install ATAT package and generate SQS structure
Then use sqs2poscar code to transfer sqs outfile into POSCAR formate.
This code is copied from https://github.com/changning/sqs2poscar.git

A c++ code to convert bestsqs.out generated by mcsqs (ATAT) to POSCAR for VASP.

Compile: c++ ./sqs2poscar.cpp -o ./sqs2poscar

Usage: sqs2poscar bestsqs.out

Output file: bestsqs.out-POSCAR

Post-processing: change xxx in the second line of output POSCAR file to your lattice constant.

Note: bestsqs.out can be any file at present working directory.

Update
After the code was released, c++ compiler on Linux seems to have added some changes to the default libraries. If you find the following errors:

sqs2poscar.cpp:218: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:222: error: ‘strcat’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:225: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:251: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
you can solve these errors by adding these two lines into the head of the sqs2poscar.cpp file:

#include <cstring>
#include <stdlib.h>

#### TO TRACK THE MC STEP ### 
add lines ending with "// Added by Yichen" to mcsqs.c++ in ATAT
It will produce a file called "step_record.txt" 
The first column is the number of best sqs structures. 
The second column is the number of mc swap needed to generate the best sqs structures
